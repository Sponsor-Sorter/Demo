        <h1>About Sponsor Sorter</h1>
        <p>
            Founded by visionary entrepreneur <strong>Johnathan Buschman</strong> in 2021, Sponsor Sorter was born out of a simple idea:
            to empower creators and brands to connect more seamlessly and transparently. What started as a side project in a shared co-working
            space has now grown into a thriving sponsorship ecosystem powering <strong>thousands of deals</strong> every month.
        </p>
        <p>
            Johnathan, a former creator himself, understood the pain points of negotiating deals, chasing payments, and building trust with sponsors.
            Sponsor Sorter solves that with verified profiles, real-time analytics, and automation tools that let creators focus on what they do best ‚Äî creating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Sponsor Sorter stands as a beacon for digital talent and brand partnerships, trusted by industry leaders and emerging influencers alike.
